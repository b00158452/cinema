Tu Dublin Cinema

Description

TU Dublin Cinema is a web application that serves as a premier destination for movie entertainment in Dublin. It provides users with access to the latest movies, special events, and cinema information. The application follows a 3-tier architecture using the MVC design pattern, with HTML5, CSS, and PHP for presentation, logic, and data processing respectively. MySQL is used for data storage, and PDO is used for secure database interactions.

Installation

Navigate to the homepage (index.php) to browse the latest movies and special events. Register or log in to access additional features such as booking tickets and viewing user-specific content. Explore the different sections of the website, including "About Us", "Contact Us", and "List of Films". Admin users can access additional functionalities such as managing films and shows through the admin panel. Core Features

MVC Design Pattern: Separates files and functionality into Model, View, and Controller for better code organization. CRUD Functions with PDO: Implements Create, Read, Update, Delete operations using PDO for secure database interactions. User Authentication: Allows users to register, log in, and log out securely. Input Validation and Sanitization: Ensures all user input is correctly formatted and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities. Database for Film Management: Utilizes a MySQL database to store information about movies, shows, and user data. Sessions for Persistent Data: Uses sessions for maintaining user authentication state and storing temporary data. Templating and Navigation: Implements well-structured templates for consistent presentation and clear navigation. Improved Grades

To improve grades, consider:

Implementing custom PHP classes and functions to encapsulate reusable logic. Ensuring code follows the DRY principle to avoid redundancy. Using version control (e.g., Git) and testing practices (e.g., unit testing) to ensure code quality and stability. Providing thorough documentation and examples demonstrating a solid understanding of core features.
